        <h2>Greenhouse Gases</h2>
        
        <p>Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and other gases stick in our atmosphere (for different residence times) and increase average global temperature in four steps.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Ultraviolet solar radiation is absorbed by the Earth, which heats up</li>
            <li>The Earth radiates infrared radiation to space</li>
            <li>Greenhouse gases absorb and re-emit some of this infrared radiation back to Earth</li>
            <li>Post-industrial atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases can keep more thermal energy in the troposphere, causing average global temperature to rise</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Global Climate Change</h2>
        
        <p>Primarily caused by average temperature increase, climates are changing worldwide. Listed here are just a few of the direct and indirect effects of global climate change. Many of these are currently occuring.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Glaciers melt</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Sea levels rise</li>
                <li>Thermohaline circulation shuts down</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Species' habitats move, grow, or shrink</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Some species must migrate or face extinction</li>
                <li>Disease vectors like mosquitos can spread to new locations</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
