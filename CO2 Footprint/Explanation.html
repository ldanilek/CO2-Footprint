        <h2>Greenhouse Gases</h2>
        
        <p>Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and other gases stick in our atmosphere for different residence times and increase average global temperature in four steps.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Ultraviolet solar radiation is absorbed by the Earth, which heats up</li>
            <li>The Earth radiates infrared radiation to space</li>
            <li>Greenhouse gases absorb and re-emit some infrared radiation back to Earth</li>
            <li>Post-industrial atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases can keep more thermal energy in the troposphere</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Global Climate Change</h2>
        
        <p>Primarily caused by average temperature increase, climates are changing worldwide. Listed here are just a few of the direct and indirect effects of global climate change.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Glaciers melt</li>
            <li>Sea levels rise</li>
            <li>Thermohaline circulation shuts down</li>
        </ul>
